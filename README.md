# Summary 

This project is a time series analysis of ERCOT Energy Consumption throughout the years. I attempt to decompose and seperate out yearly, monthly, and daily trends in the ERCOT Energy market serving the state of Texas. As the state's population continues to grow, and as Summers are hitting new record temperatures, Texas' energy supply is coming under more strain than ever.
